# CISC 881 Team Assignment

To run the model on an input image, run the following command with the specified input image in your directory

<code>python process.py ./input ./output</code>

The pretrained model which was trained for our assignment is under the name david_nikki_model.pth in this github repository.

<em>Note: There are certain places in the code in which the directories must be hard coded in. This is due to the split between the training and testing data, and creatomg separate metadata.csv files for the separate datasets.</em>
